# dropbox-backup
Basic BASH script to backup all dropbox files based on the date.

## How it works
This script adds a entry to the system crontab to run this script every day at whatever time you specify. In the `install.sh` file, there are several flags that you are able to change in order to make the script work. They are commented at the top of the install.sh file.
